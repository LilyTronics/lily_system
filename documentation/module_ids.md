# Lily System™ Module IDs

This document contains all the module IDs.
The module ID must be unique for every module.

The module ID consists of 4 bytes. The first 2 bytes is the manufacturer code.
The second four bytes is the module specific code.

The module ID is created by using the manufacturer code followed by the module specific code.

For readability, in the application, a '-' is placed between the two parts.
